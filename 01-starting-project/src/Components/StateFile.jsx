             <h3>STATE </h3>
             <p> In React, state refers to the data that represents the current condition or values of a component.
                 It allows React components to keep track of and manage dynamic information, such as user input, 
                 API responses, or changes in the componentâ€™s internal state. 
                State is crucial for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces in React applications.</p>
