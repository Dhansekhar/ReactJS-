                It is commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like.
                 JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React applications by converting HTML tags into React elements.`

        discrption:`In React, state refers to the data that represents the current condition or values of a component.
                 It allows React components to keep track of and manage dynamic information, such as user input, 
                 API responses, or changes in the componentâ€™s internal state. 
                State is crucial for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces in React applications.`
