⦁	What is ReactJS ? and why would use it ?

ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library (created by Facebook, now Meta) used for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs) where you want fast, dynamic, and interactive UI updates without constantly reloading the page.

What ReactJS is

Component-based: You build your UI as reusable components (like Lego blocks).

Declarative: You describe what you want the UI to look like, and React figures out how to update it.

Virtual DOM: React uses an in-memory copy of the DOM


⦁	ReactJS VS Vanilla JavaScript ?

Small, simple website → Vanilla JS is fine.

Dynamic web app with lots of interactive parts → ReactJS shines.
